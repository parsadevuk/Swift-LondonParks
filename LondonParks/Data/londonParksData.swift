//St James’s Park is hands down our favourite of the famous parks in London.
//Flanked by Buckingham Palace to one side, The Mall, Westminster and Horse Guards Parade to the others, St James’s Park is a peaceful and picturesque green space covering about 23 hectares.
//It’s hard to believe that you can find somewhere so quiet in between some of London’s most important spots (it’s also right next to 10 Downing Street) – but that’s London for you.
//The park is particularly loved by bird watchers, as there is a large lake with two islands within it. Around it, there are various birds including pelicans, waterfowl and duck.
//The sight of the lake, islands and birds certainly makes it a gorgeous sight. If you’re looking for nice parks in London, then James’s Park deserves a spot near the top of your list.
