🌳 This is a straightforward iOS application 📱 that showcases the top 12 parks in London 🇬🇧. The first page of the app resembles a boarding pass 💳, allowing users to swipe 🔜 through different parks. The card displays a small map 🗺️ on the top, followed by an image of the park in a circular border 🌳. Each park has its own distinct color theme 🎨, which is determined by two color hex codes in the background and the circular border of the image. The app also includes a gallery 📷 for each park, featuring at least 12 pictures. The gallery can be expanded 🔍 by tapping on it, and is located at the end of the page with more information 💡. The park data is stored in a JSON file 💾 and is programmatically retrieved 💻.
